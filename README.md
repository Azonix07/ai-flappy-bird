## 🧬 How It Works

### Neural Network Architecture
```
Inputs (6 nodes):
├── Bird Y position (normalized)
├── Bird velocity (normalized) 
├── Distance to next gap (normalized)
├── Gap center position (normalized)
├── Height difference from gap center
└── Frames since last flap

Hidden Layer (12 nodes):
└── ReLU activation function

Output (1 node):
└── Flap decision (Sigmoid activation)
```

## 🧮 Matrix System in Neural Networks

The neural network in AI Flappy Bird relies on matrix operations for efficient computation of the bird's decisions. This system uses linear algebra to process inputs through the network layers.

### Weight Matrices Structure

The network consists of two weight matrices that define the connections between neurons:

1. **Input-Hidden Matrix** (6×12): Connects 6 input features to 12 hidden neurons
2. **Hidden-Output Matrix** (12×1): Connects 12 hidden neurons to 1 output neuron

### Forward Propagation Process

The decision-making happens through matrix multiplication:

```
Hidden_Activations = Input_Vector × Input_Hidden_Matrix
Hidden_Output = ReLU(Hidden_Activations)
Final_Output = Sigmoid(Hidden_Output × Hidden_Output_Matrix)
```

### Detailed Example

Let's walk through a concrete example with sample values:

**Input Features** (normalized between 0-1):
```
Bird Y Position:     0.5
Bird Velocity:       0.2
Distance to Gap:     0.8
Gap Center Y:        0.6
Height Difference:   0.1
Frames Since Flap:   0.3
```

**Input Vector** (1×6):
```
[0.5, 0.2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.1, 0.3]
```

**Sample Input-Hidden Weights** (6×12 matrix, showing first 3 columns):
```
┌                     ┐
│ 0.12  -0.45  0.78  │
│ 0.34   0.67 -0.23  │
│-0.56   0.89  0.12  │
│ 0.45  -0.34  0.56  │
│ 0.78   0.23 -0.67  │
│-0.12   0.45  0.89  │
└                     ┘
```

**Hidden Layer Calculation** (first 3 neurons):
```
Hidden[0] = (0.5×0.12) + (0.2×0.34) + (0.8×-0.56) + (0.6×0.45) + (0.1×0.78) + (0.3×-0.12) = 0.23
Hidden[1] = (0.5×-0.45) + (0.2×0.67) + (0.8×0.89) + (0.6×-0.34) + (0.1×0.23) + (0.3×0.45) = 0.67
Hidden[2] = (0.5×0.78) + (0.2×-0.23) + (0.8×0.12) + (0.6×0.56) + (0.1×-0.67) + (0.3×0.89) = 0.89
```

**After ReLU Activation** (negative values become 0):
```
Hidden_Output = [0.23, 0.67, 0.89, ...]  (12 values)
```

**Hidden-Output Weights** (12×1 matrix, sample values):
```
┌    ┐
│ 0.45 │
│-0.23 │
│ 0.67 │
│ 0.12 │
│-0.78 │
│ 0.34 │
│ 0.56 │
│-0.45 │
│ 0.89 │
│ 0.23 │
│-0.67 │
│ 0.12 │
└    ┘
```

**Final Output Calculation**:
```
Raw_Output = Σ(Hidden_Output[i] × Hidden_Output_Weights[i]) = 0.76
Flap_Decision = Sigmoid(0.76) = 0.68
```

**Decision**: Since 0.68 > 0.5, the bird decides to flap!

This matrix system allows the AI to process complex relationships between game state variables and make intelligent decisions in real-time.

**Inspired by**: NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) and genetic programming principles: How the System Works

## Introduction
Welcome! This is a fun project where we teach computers to play Flappy Bird using artificial intelligence. We'll explain everything step by step, like you're learning it for the first time. No fancy words without explanations!

## What is Flappy Bird?
Flappy Bird is a simple game where a bird flies through pipes. The bird falls down due to gravity, and you tap to make it flap up. The goal is to go through as many pipes as possible without hitting them.

In our version, **no human plays** - the computer controls everything!

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI means making computers think and learn like humans. Here, we use two main ideas:
1. **Neural Networks** - Like a tiny brain inside each bird
2. **Evolution** - Birds get better over time, like animals in nature

## Neural Networks: The Bird's Brain
Each bird has a tiny "brain" that decides when to flap. Think of it as a decision-making machine.

### How It Works
The brain takes **inputs** (information) and gives **outputs** (decisions).

**Inputs (4 pieces of information):**
- Where the bird is on the screen (up/down)
- How fast the bird is moving (up or down)
- Height of the top pipe
- Height of the bottom pipe

**Output (1 decision):**
- Flap or don't flap (yes/no)

### The Brain's Structure
```
Inputs → Hidden Layer → Output
   4   →     8       →   1
```

**Neural Network Diagram:**
```
Input Layer     Hidden Layer     Output Layer
   [I1]           [H1]              [O1]
   [I2]           [H2]              (Flap?)
   [I3]           [H3]
   [I4]           [H4]
                 [H5]
                 [H6]
                 [H7]
                 [H8]

Connections: I1→H1, I1→H2, ..., I4→H8, H1→O1, ..., H8→O1
```

- **Input layer**: 4 numbers (the information above)
- **Hidden layer**: 8 "thinking" units
- **Output layer**: 1 number (0 = don't flap, 1 = flap)

### Mathematics: How the Brain Thinks
The brain uses simple math to make decisions:

1. **Multiplication**: Each connection has a "weight" (like importance)
   ```
   Input × Weight = Signal
   ```

2. **Addition**: Add up all signals
   ```
   Signal1 + Signal2 + Signal3 + ... = Total
   ```

3. **Sigmoid Function**: Squish the total into a number between 0 and 1
   ```
   Sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
   ```
   - If x is big positive: result ≈ 1
   - If x is big negative: result ≈ 0
   - If x is zero: result ≈ 0.5

**Sigmoid Function Graph:**
```
Output
  1.0 |          .--------
      |        .'
      |      .'
  0.5 |....'
      |   .'
      |  .'
  0.0 |.'          --------
      +-------------------- Input
        -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3
```

This gives us a number between 0 and 1. If > 0.5, the bird flaps!

## Evolution: Getting Smarter Over Time
Birds start with random brains and get better through "evolution" (like natural selection).

### How Evolution Works
1. **Generation**: A group of 100 birds plays the game
2. **Fitness**: How well each bird did (score = how many pipes passed)
3. **Selection**: Pick the best birds to be "parents"
4. **Crossover**: Mix parents' brains to make babies
5. **Mutation**: Add small random changes
6. **Repeat**: New generation with improved brains

### Mathematics in Evolution
**Fitness Calculation:**
```
Fitness = Score × Score
```
(Better scores get much higher fitness - rewards good birds more)

**Selection:**
- Calculate total fitness of all birds
- Pick randomly, but better birds more likely to be chosen
- Like a lottery where good birds have more tickets

**Crossover:**
- Take half the "weights" from mom, half from dad
- Creates a mix of both parents' brains

**Mutation:**
- 10% chance to change each weight
- Add small random number (-0.1 to +0.1)
- Prevents getting stuck, adds new ideas

**Fitness Distribution Chart:**
```
Fitness
  High |     ████  (Best birds)
        |   ████████
        | ████████████
  Low   |██████████████████  (Most birds)
        +--------------------
          Score: 0 → 1000
```

**Selection Process:**
```
Bird A (Score: 100) - Fitness: 10,000
Bird B (Score: 200) - Fitness: 40,000  ← More likely to be picked!
Bird C (Score: 50)  - Fitness: 2,500
```

## The Complete System
1. **Start**: 100 birds with random brains
2. **Play**: Each bird uses its brain to decide when to flap
3. **Die**: Birds hit pipes or go off screen
4. **Evolve**: Best birds make new generation
5. **Repeat**: Birds get better each time!

**Evolution Progress Over Time:**
```
Generation
   20 |          ██████████ (Birds playing forever!)
      |
   15 |       ████████
      |
   10 |    ██████
      |
    5 |  ████
      |
    1 | ██  (Random - crash immediately)
      +---------------------------------- Time
        Gen 1    5    10    15    20
```

**Score Improvement:**
```
Score
 1000 |          ██████████
      |
  750 |       ████████
      |
  500 |    ██████
      |
  250 |  ████
      |
    0 | ██
      +---------------------------------- Generation
        1    5    10    15    20
```
